This Library is a wrapper for the [Polar BLE SDK](https://github.com/polarofficial/polar-ble-sdk)

aiming to make it easier to use in React Native. The SDK is focussed mainly on extacting the PPG data from the Polar Devices.

implemented by following this [method](https://morioh.com/p/4ac72069eeca)
