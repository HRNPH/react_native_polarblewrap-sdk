# React-native-polarblewrap-sdk
This Library is a wrapper for the [Polar BLE SDK](https://github.com/polarofficial/polar-ble-sdk)

aiming to make it easier to use in React Native. The SDK is focussed mainly on extacting the PPG data from the Polar Devices.

implemented by following this [method](https://morioh.com/p/4ac72069eeca)

## Maintainance
- will probably be maintained untill the official SDK is released for React Native.
- my research is done.
- untill i found better devices alternatives.

## Getting started

`$ npm install react-native-polarblewrap-sdk --save`

### Mostly automatic installation

`$ react-native link react-native-polarblewrap-sdk`

### Manual installation



## Usage
```javascript
import RNPolarblewrapSdk from 'react-native-polarblewrap-sdk';

// TODO: What to do with the module?
RNPolarblewrapSdk;
```
